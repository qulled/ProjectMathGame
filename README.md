A project in which I tried to contribute the maximum amount of basic knowledge related to Python.
The project is written according to the PEP8 rules, taking into account the spelling and algorithmic properties of the programming language. 
Also, functions are applied here, writing and reading from a text file, creating a mini database and the content of the player's state progress in it.
Start programm from main.py file.
